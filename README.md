This repository contains the "Booz Allen Public License".

Please note an important clarification: while this license is mentioned in [Open Source Solutions](https://www.boozallen.com/expertise/digital-solutions/open-source.html), this is *not* an open source software license.

That's because the license includes these terms:

> License. [each Originator grants You a license] for the sole purpose of Your internal business purposes and the provision of services to government, non-profit academic, and other non-profit entities.
...
> Commercial Sales. You may not distribute, or allow third parties to access or use, the Product or any Derivative for a fee, unless You first obtain permission from the Originator.

Software under this license can only be used for internal business and by government and non-profits, and it requires a fee for further distribution.

This does not meet the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd), which requires:

> 1. Free Redistribution
> The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.
and
> 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
> The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

It also does not meet the definition given in the [Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and  Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software (M-16-21)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf) : "Open Source Software (OSS): Software that can be accessed, used, modified, and shared by anyone." Since it can't be used or shared by anyone, it can't be open source software.
